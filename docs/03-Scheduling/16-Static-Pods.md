# Static Pods 
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/courses/539883/lectures/10352432)
  
In this section, we will take a look at Static Pods
Static Pods are managed directly by the kubelet daemon on a specific node, without the API server observing them. Unlike Pods that are managed by the control plane (for example, a Deployment); instead, the kubelet watches each static Pod (and restarts it if it fails).

Static Pods are always bound to one Kubelet on a specific node.

The kubelet automatically tries to create a mirror Pod on the Kubernetes API server for each static Pod. This means that the Pods running on a node are visible on the API server, but cannot be controlled from there. The Pod names will suffixed with the node hostname with a leading hyphen

#### How do you provide a pod definition file to the kubelet without a kube-apiserver?
- You can configure the kubelet to read the pod definition files from a directory on the server designated to store information about pods.

## Configure Static Pod
- The designated directory can be any directory on the host and the location of that directory is passed in to the kubelet as an option while running the service.
  - The option is named as **`--pod-manifest-path`**.

## Another way to configure static pod 
- Instead of specifying the option directly in the **`kubelet.service`** file, you could provide a path to another config file using the config option, and define the directoy path as staticPodPath in the file.

## View the static pods
- To view the static pods
  ```
  $ docker ps
  ```

#### The kubelet can create both kinds of pods - the static pods and the ones from the api server at the same time.
